# BloomFilter_CDS_Project
The purpose of this project is to implement a space-efficient probabilistic data structure of a bloom filter that checks if an item belongs to a list, using a small amount of computer memory. Namely, if it is not on the list, it will definitely not be on the list. However, if an item is mentioned to be in the list, there is still a small chance that it could be a False Positive.

## Description
The Bloom filter, a probability data structure used to determine if an entry is related to a set, is implemented in this repository. The project involves constructing the data structure from the beginning into a Python, assessing various hash function families, and using an HPC infrastructure to benchmark its performance (time and space complexity).

## Getting Started

### Project Structure
* `bloom_filter.py`: The core implementation of the Bloom Filter data structure using optimized hash functions.
* `benchmark.py`: The main testing script that generates synthetic data, loads external datasets, and measures performance metrics.
* `job.sh`: The SLURM batch script configured for submitting the benchmark job to the **Wice** HPC cluster.
* `words_dictionary.json`: The external dataset containing approximately 370,000 common English words used for nominal text data testing. *(Note: This file must be downloaded and placed in the root directory before running).*

### Datasets Evaluated
The benchmarking suite tests the Bloom Filter against three distinct data profiles, scaling up to 200,000 items:
1. **Nominal Data (Unstructured Text):** Real English words loaded from the JSON dictionary.
2. **Nominal Data (Structured Patterns):** Synthetically generated 20-character DNA sequences (A, C, G, T).
3. **Numerical Data:** Randomly generated 8-digit identification numbers (e.g., Bank IDs).

### Dependencies
Since this project runs on HPC supercomputer, it relies on an isolated environment to manage dependencies.
* Platform Environment: Supercomputer Cluster
* Environment Manager: Conda
* Runtime Environment: Python 3.8+
* Libraries and Modules: Math, Hashlib, Time, Random, JSON, Bloom_filter, BloomFilter
* Dataset: words_dictionary.json

## Installing
You can pull or transfer the program files into your target HPC.
Either clone it directly into your designated space via 'git clone' or you can deploy the entire project architecture via 'scp' directly to your cluster directory.
The first method is preferred if your cluster nodes maintain outbound internet clearance. Since it allows a supercomputer node to connect to the external internet.


## Executing a program
1. Log into the supercomputer node using terminal
2. Initialise the Conda environment
3. Clone the project from git
4. Do a batch submission for a large MAX_LIM size

E.g.:
`#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH --job-name=bloom_benchmark
#SBATCH --account=lp_h_ds_students
#SBATCH --cluster=wice
#SBATCH --time=00:15:00
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1`

5. Submit it to the HPC queue:

E.g:`sbatch submit_job.sh`
